```ruby
=begin
Given array nums of n integers, return array of all UNIQUE quadruplets summing to 0
a, b, c, and d must all be DISTINCT (e.g can't pick same twice)
[1, 0, -1, 0, -2, 2]
[1, 0, -1, 0]
[1, 0, -1, -2]
[1, 0, -1, 2]
[1, 0, 0, -2]
...
Sort array
2sum
[-2, -1, 0, 0, 1, 2]
L                 R
If L + R is 0, that's your answer!
Otherwise move pointers based on result

3sum
[-2, -1, 0, 0, 1, 2]
For each number, 2sum on remaining length
-2 + 0 = -2, reach to hit -2 using [-1, 0, 0, 1, 2]
Avoid duplicates by skipping cases where nbr is same as previous nbr
Whenever you hit a "same" case
Skip all numbers L/R pointers that are duplicates

4sum
[-2, -1, 0, 0, 1, 2]
For each number, 3sum on the remaining length
Skip duplicates
=end
