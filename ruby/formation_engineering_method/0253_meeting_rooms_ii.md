```ruby
# Given intervals of start/end inclusive
# Find minimum # of days required to schedule all meetings w/ no conflicts
# Two numbers touching isn't a conflict, only overlapping is a conflict
# put end times into a min heap
# keep track of max heap size
# pop end times from heap if current time is >=
```
