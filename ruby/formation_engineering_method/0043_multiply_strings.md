```ruby
=begin
Given two non-negative integers represented as strings, return their product as string
CANNOT USE BUILT-IN BIG INTEGER OR CONVERT INPUTS TO INTEGERS DIRECTLY

Naive: Bigadd to create Bigmult? Sounds inefficient haha.
More efficient: Think multiplication as a kid
y (0-last)
    x (0 - last)
How to see where to put products?
x + y
=end
```
