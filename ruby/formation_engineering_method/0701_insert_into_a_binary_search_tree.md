```ruby
=begin
given root of BST, value to insert
return root of BST after insertion
guaranteed that new value does not already exist in BST
Rules of BST?
All nodes to left less, all nodes to right greater
Look at current node: is it less or greater than?
Go left or right (unless node doesn't exist there, then place it there)
=end
```
