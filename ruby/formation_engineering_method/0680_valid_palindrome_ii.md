```ruby
=begin
given s
return true if s can be a palindrome after deleting at most 1 character
see if left/right match
if match, continue
if NOT match, either move left/right to make match (if neither create a match, false)
What happens when you can go either way?
E.g, on a smaller subset?
=end
```
