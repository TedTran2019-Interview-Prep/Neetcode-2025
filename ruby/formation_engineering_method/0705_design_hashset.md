```ruby
=begin
add, contains(key), remove(key)
Only need to check if contains, not return the element itself
What happens on collision -> check if keys are the same or not
Still need an array of linked lists (using arrays to make it simpler) and resize
Since all the keys are numbers could just do modulo without hashing.
=end
```
