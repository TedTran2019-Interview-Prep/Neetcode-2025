```ruby
=begin
s: all numbers 1 to n
one number in s got duplicated to another number in set
repetition of one, loss of one
find missing + occurred twice number
go from 1 to whatever, if that number is missing, add it
if find duplicate, add that
if you have duplicate at start/end is issue, need to see what's missing
e.g, 2, 2 you know first one should be a 1
e.g 1 1, second number should be a 2
question is also-- what's the one number I should change to make array sequential?
Find the one character that is duplicated
Find the character that doesn't exist in 1 to N using same hashmap
=end
```
