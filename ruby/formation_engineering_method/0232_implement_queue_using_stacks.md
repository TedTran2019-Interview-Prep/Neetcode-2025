```ruby
=begin
Implement a queue using 2 stacks
Can only use standard operations of a stack
If push, push into stack 1
if stack 2 is empty?
    If peek, pop everything from stack 1 to stack 2  then show top element
    If pop, pop everything from stack 1 to stack 2 then pop top element
else
    just pop/peek from stack2
Size is stack1 + stack2
Is empty is if stack1 + stack2 are empty?
=end
```
