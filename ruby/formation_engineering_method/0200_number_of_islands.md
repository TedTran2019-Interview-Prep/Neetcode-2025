```ruby
=begin
m*n grid, with 1: land, 0: water
return number of islands (completely surrounded by water)
hehe, FLOOD fill every single space in grid until can't expand further
Mark spaces already traveled
Count number of starting spaces that haven't been traveled + not 0
Honestly, can just change 1' to 0 and it'd count as "traveled/water", same thing
=end
```
