```ruby
=begin
return # of palindromic substrings in S
reads same forward/backwards
substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string
1-1000 length
size 1 == palindrome

To count palindromes, use expands outward method?
Count every time there is a valid answer...
'a' -> 'aa' -> 'aaa'
'a' -> 'aa'
'a'
=end
```
