```ruby
=begin
Kth largest element in an array
min heap
add to heap until size k
then offer only
return peek
OR
heapify a max heap and pop off k elements

There's also a "quick select" algorithm solution, with better average case but worse worst case
Think quicksort and it's quite similar to binary search in a way
=end
```
