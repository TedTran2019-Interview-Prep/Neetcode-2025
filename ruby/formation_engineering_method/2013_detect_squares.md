Geometry: what's the easy way to determine a square/rectangle?
Find a single diagonal (query point to any other point)
Check in hashmap if other two relevant points exist
Store counts of each point (and multiply 3 other point counts)
If top right is (point x, point y)
bottom left is (x, y)
Top left is x, point y
Bottom right is point x, y

How is something diagonal for a square? x and y away is equal
Area has to be > 0!
=end
