```ruby
=begin
Implement pow(x, n)
calculates x raised to the power n
With Ruby you can just do x**n, but that defeats the purpose of implementation

There's some math formula I don't recall for this, where you can do something
clever instead of just manually multiplying the number by itself a bunch of times
Oh yeah, exponentiation by squaring.
How to logically figure that out?

Divide and conquer... notice the repeated work?
2^10 is just 2^5 * itself
2^5 is 2^2 * 2^2 * 2
2^2 is just 2 * 2...
logn instead of n time complexity using this divide n' conquer strat!

n is always an integer, x doesn't have to be
Two base cases, x == 0, n == 0
=end
```
