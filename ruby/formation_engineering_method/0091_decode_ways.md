```ruby
=begin
'1' -> 'A'
'26' -> 'Z'
All possible diff ways to decode the message

Damn this problem was hard.

A big intuition to this problem is-- every time you choose A/B successfully, that's an additional
way to decode. There's no way of running into repeats. So all the problem really is, is House
Robber but w/ additional constraints.
