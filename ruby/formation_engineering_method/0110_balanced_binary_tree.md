```ruby
# Determine if binary tree is height balanced
# Two subtree depths never differ by more than 1
# Find depth of left/right. Return false unless left/right are within 1 height of each other
# Duh, order doesn't matter if you take absolute value after, you get the raw difference between two numbers.
```
