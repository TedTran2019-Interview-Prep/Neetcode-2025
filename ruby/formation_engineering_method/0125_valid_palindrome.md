```ruby
# Convert all uppercase into lowercase
# Remove all non-alphanumeric
# Same forward and backwards
# Since I won't remember the Regex 'asdf'.match(/\A[a-zA-Z]+\z/), let's be realistic.

# Go through the string, creating an array with only letters/numbers and make sure they're lowercased
# Then do left/right and make sure they're all the same or it's false
```
