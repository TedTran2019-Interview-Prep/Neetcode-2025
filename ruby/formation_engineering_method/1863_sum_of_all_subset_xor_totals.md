```ruby
=begin
xor total of an array is xor of all elements, or 0 if empty
[2, 5, 6] = 1
return XOR total sum for every subset of nums

How do I get subsets? (Combinations), (Combinations vs permutations vs partitions)
For every element, you either choose it or not choose it
If you xor something twice, it removes that value, so can undo the total easily
So this problem is same as combinations

But what's the limiting factor? You want all sizes
=end
```
